Riad Hassan, Lecturer, department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in Green University of Bangladesh ([GUB](https://green.edu.bd/faculty-profile/dept-of-cse/md-riad-hassan/)) and pursuing *Research Based MSc* from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology ([BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/)). Beside those, I also conduct research with [BioRAIN Lab](https://biorainlab.net/author/riad-hassan/). My research interests are:
* Deep Learning
* Medical Imaging
* Region of Interest
* Image Processing

Transforming research outputs into daily usable applications is fun. **Interested in innovative research project**. Kindly [let me know](mailto:riad_hassan@outlook.com). I will definitely get back to you.
