I am Riad Hassan, completed my B.Sc. (Engineering) in Information and Communication Engineering (ICE) from Pabna University of science and technology ([PUST](https://pust.ac.bd/)). Currently, I am working as Lecturer at the department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in Green University of Bangladesh ([GUB](https://green.edu.bd/faculty-profile/dept-of-cse/md-riad-hassan/)) and pursuing masters degree from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology ([BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/)).

I have conducted a research on Region of Interest (ROI) with Charles Sturt University, Australia. Recently **I am working on Medical Imaging**, to be more specific Multi-Organ at Risk (OAR) Segmentation from CT scan. My research area are:

* Medical Imaging
* Region of Interest
* Image Processing

I want to maintain *T-shaped* research skills where the depth domain is Medical Imaging. So, I am interested to explore more areas of deep learning (i.e. NLP, autonomous vehicle), Bioinformatics, IoT..... Transforming research outputs into daily usable applications is fun.

**Interested in innovative research project**. Kindly [let me know](mailto:riad_hassan@outlook.com) even if it is not within my scope. I will definitely get back to you.
