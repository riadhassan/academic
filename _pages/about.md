Riad Hassan, Lecturer, department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in Green University of Bangladesh ([GUB](https://green.edu.bd/faculty-profile/dept-of-cse/md-riad-hassan/)) and pursuing *Research Based MSc* from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology ([BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/)). **I am working Medical Imaging**, to be more specific Multi-Organ at Risk (OAR) Segmentation from CT scan. My research area are:
* Medical Imaging
* Region of Interest
* Image Processing

Transforming research outputs into daily usable applications is fun. I want to maintain *T-shaped* research skills where the depth domain is Medical Imaging. So, I am interested to explore more areas of deep learning (i.e. NLP, autonomous vehicle), Bioinformatics, IoT..... **Interested in innovative research project**. Kindly [let me know](mailto:riad_hassan@outlook.com). I will definitely get back to you.
