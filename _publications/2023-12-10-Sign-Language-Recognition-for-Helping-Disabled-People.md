People with disabilities have difficulty in communicating, social interaction, obsessions and repetitive behaviours. The situation gets risky when these disabled people left alone freely in the outside world. But they shouldn't be locked up for this reason. So we need a way to help and protect them. Sign language recognition is the field related to communication which is a visual language that uses body language and facial expressions to convey meaning. Recent technological advances have enabled the development of advanced sign language recognition systems that can interpret sign language and translate it into written and spoken language. These systems typically use computer vision techniques to analyse sign language gestures and movements and map them to written or spoken language. Sign language recognition technology have the potential to greatly improve the accessibility of communication for people with hearing and speech impairments and to improve communication between people who speak different languages. In this paper, our proposed system has achieved the accuracy of 91.67% which is better compared to the existing works in the literature.
